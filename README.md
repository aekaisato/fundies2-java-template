# generator for fundies 2 java templates

prob shoudlve just done it in java, but i couldnt figure out an easy way to do "methods for fields", and im not too familiar with java tooling, so screw it--*javascript*!

no guarantees as to whether it'll work for your file or not. also double check anything marked with `[~]` and manually add anything with `[^]`

## Usage
```
git clone git@github.com:aekaisato/fundies2-java-template.git
cd fundies2-java-template
yarn install
node index.js [path/to/java/file]
```
